# Project White Wolf

Our project aims to find reasonable software solutions that prevent or reduce Healthcare Associated Infections (HAI).
In today’s society it’s hard to find common aspects of life that affect everyone. However, this is not the case when speaking to healthcare. Unfortunately, the high monetary cost of healthcare and an individual’s socio-economic standing usually correlate to the quality of healthcare people receive. As medical advances increase the lifespan of the aging population we can assume that the cost of healthcare will continue to rise causing tax payers to pay the brunt of those increased cost.
In an effort to decrease the cost of healthcare, we analyzed the affect of Healthcare Associated Infections (HAI) and how potential software applications can be utilized to reduce instances of HAI’s in healthcare facilities. 

Software Solutions: 

Application - Threat Map
The threat map application utilizes data as a surveillance method to reduce HAI events. The threat map takes input as variables from internal databases and transforms
these variables into a threat rating which is applied to an overall HAI risk rating for each patient within the hospital. Example variables include 
the patients illness, age and other demographic information as well as the number of nurse visits, number of outside visitors, the last time the patients room was cleaned,
patients length of stay, and others. An overall threat rating for each patient will give hospital staff the information needed to efficiently allocate resources to the highest priority.      

Application -To Do Check List
Current methods to reduce HAI rely on hospital staff following strict protocols. Unfortunately, due to a lack of resources and the hectic environment of 
a hospital, protocols often get missed. The "To Do Check List" is an application that can run on a wearable device such as the apple watch that informs hospital staff
of the correct protocol that needs to be followed, but more importantly it alerts hospital staff of protocols that were missed while caring for a patient. The application
also allows for the integration into patient monitoring equipment that can instantaneously alert staff of an issue.      

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system
