Threat Map Variables:

Patient Illness Threat Level:
-This varible will take in multiple other varibles about the patients
illness(reason for being in the hospital) and the patients demographic information. However,
for the purpose of this demo we will aggregate these varibles into one threat rating.
SCALE - 1 to 10: 1 being the lowest risk, 10 being highest risk.

included varibles
-Type of Illiness: 1 to 10 rating - a rating of 1 would mean that the patients illness is not suseptiable 
to catching an HAI. A rating of 10 would mean that the patients illness causes the patient to be at a higher risk of 
acquiring an HAI. these types of illness would include illnesses that causes the immune system to be weakened. 

-Patient Age: 1 to 10 rating - the older the patients age, the higher the rating will be. However, young children would also
receive a high rating as they are more suseptiable to HAI.   

Patient Length of Stay:
-This variable will be a single integer that increases by one for each day that the patient is in the hospital.
the longer the patient is in the hospital the more suseptiable they are to acquiring an HAI.

Number of Nurse Visits:
-This varible would be a single integer that counts the number of nurse visits to the patients room. Increased visits
by nurses increases the HAI threat level.   

Number of Visitors:
-This variable will be a single integer that counts the number of visitors that a patient has received. A high number
of visitors increases that chance that they may bring outside infections into the patients room. 

Time of Last Waste Disposal:
-This variable will be a single integer that counts the number of hours from the last time the patient waste was removed
from their room. As time increases between waste disposal, the HAI threat increases. Once the waste has been disposed, 
the rating will return to zero. 

Time of Last Room Cleaning:
-This variable will be a single integer that counts the number of hours from the last time the patients room was cleaned.
As time increases betwen room cleaning, the HAI threat increases. Once the room is cleaned the rating will return to zero.

All variables are added up to create a single threat rating based off the sum of the variables. 

Example 1:
Patient Illness Threat level:
-Illness - HIV = 9
-Age - 75 = 9
Patient Illness Threat level Total = 9

Patient length of Stay:
-length of Stay = 5

Number of Nurse Visits:
-Nurse Visits = 30

Time of Last Waste Disposal:
- Waste Disposal = 3 hours ago

Time of Last Room Cleaning:
-Room Cleaning = 6 hours ago

Total HAI Threat Level = 53 Very High Threat Level

Example 2:

Patient Illness Threat Level:
-Illiness - Broken hand = 2
-Age - 25 = 1
Patient Illness Threat Level Total = 1.5

Patient Length of Stay:
-length of stay = 0

Number of Nurse Visits:
-Nurse Visits = 2

Time of Last Waste Disposal:
-Waste Disposal = 1 hour ago

Time of Last Room Cleaning:
-Room Cleaning = 3 hours ago 

Total HAI Threat Level = 7.5 Very Low Threat Level
